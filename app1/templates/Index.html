    <h2 class="fw-bold">How Are Phishing Websites Used?</h2>
    <p class="fs-5">
      First, the user clicks on the <strong>"New Register"</strong> button and fills in their email and password. 
      After registration, they can log in using the same credentials by clicking the <strong>"Login"</strong> button.
    </p>
    <p class="fs-5">
      Once logged in, the user is taken to their personal home dashboard, where their email is displayed along with a 
      <strong>"Logout"</strong> button and a <strong>"Generate Instagram Phishing Link"</strong> button.
    </p>
    <p class="fs-5">
      When the user clicks the phishing link generator, a unique link is created. They can share this link with their 
      friends by saying, “This website helps you increase your Instagram followers.”
    </p>
    <p class="fs-5">
      When someone clicks and logs in through the phishing page, their Instagram username and password are saved. 
      This data is then visible on the user's home dashboard.
    </p>
    <p class="fs-5">
      The user can now use these credentials to log into the Instagram account of the victim.
